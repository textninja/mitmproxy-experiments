# mitmproxy experiments

This is a testing ground for mitmproxy scripts. They can be used with:

    mitmproxy -s SCRIPT_NAME

Alternatively, you can run the test suite via

    yarn test

The above assume that mitmproxy is installed, e.g. via `brew install mitmproxy`.

These scripts were contrived for learning purposes, so please don't expect to
get much practical value out of them.
